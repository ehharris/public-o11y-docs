   :description: Learn how to use Terraform to delete all global data links created with Terraform.

Use Terraform to programmatically delete all global data links that you created with Terraform. This process deletes all of the global data links in the terraform.tf.state file in the Terraform directory.

Prerequisites
===============

To delete global data links with Terraform, you need:

* A Splunk Observability Cloud account with the admin role. 
* The latest version of Terraform.
* Global data links created with Terraform, either with the :ref:`Node.js script<apm-create-data-links-terraform-batch>` or the :ref:`Terraform file<apm-create-data-links-terraform-file>`.

Delete all global data links with Terraform
=============================================

To delete all global data links that you created with Terraform:

#. View the terraform.tf.state file in the Terraform directory. Confirm that you want to delete all of the data links in the file.

#. Open your terminal and navigate to the Terraform directory. Run:
     .. code-block:: none

        terraform destroy -var="signalfx_auth_token=<api-access-token>" -var="signalfx_api_url=https://api.<realm>.signalfx.com"
    
    - For <api-access-token>, enter your Splunk Observability Cloud API access token. To obtain it, navigate to Splunk Observability and select your profile in the header. Select :guilabel:`My Profile`, then :guilabel:`Show User API Access Token`, and copy the API access token.
    - For <realm>, enter your Splunk Observability Cloud realm. To obtain your realm, navigate to Splunk Observability Cloud and select your profile in the header. Select :guilabel:`My Profile`, then :guilabel:`Organizations`, and copy the :guilabel:`API Endpoint`.

#. View the UI to confirm that the data links were deleted:
    #. In the Splunk Observability Cloud main menu, select :guilabel:`Settings` then :guilabel:`Global Data Link`.
    #. Search for the names of the data links you created.
        - If you used the :ref:`Node.js script method <apm-create-data-links-terraform-batch>`, search for the AppDLinkLabel values that you specified in the CSV file.
        - If you used the :ref:`Terraform file method <apm-create-data-links-terraform-file>`, search for the ``name`` values that you specified in the Terraform configuration file.
