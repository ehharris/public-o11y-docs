Test naming conventions
========================================================================================
Choosing informative names for your tests and alerts helps organize content. Here are some guidelines: 

* Add a category as a prefix to your test name like group, application, brand, or team names so that you can simplify searches. For example, these two Browser tests start with ``[ButtercupGames]``. 

* Add a description about the purpose of the test like the workflow, process, performance, or data source.
