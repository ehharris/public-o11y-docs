KPIs measure how well your tests are performing in a variety of circumstances. There are two tabs in this view on the test details page: availability and performance KPIs. The availability tab shows when the test was up and running versus failing, and if an auto-retry run occurred. 

Here are some ways you can troubleshoot issues in the performance KPI chart: 

* Zoom in on a range of time to isolate an issue. 
* Play or pause windows of time during troubleshooting to and open run results, screen captures, and charts in context with the selected data. 
* Automatically adjust data density adjusts for zoomed in views or summaries of larger time ranges. 
* VIew up to 90 days of historical data for related run results.
