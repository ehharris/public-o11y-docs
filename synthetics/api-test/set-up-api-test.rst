    :description: Steps to set up an API test in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring to check the functionality and performance of API endpoints.

An API test provides a flexible way to check the functionality and performance of API endpoints. See :ref:`api-test` for an overview of API tests in Splunk Synthetic Monitoring.

Set up an API test
=========================

Follow these steps to set up an API test:

#. From the landing page of Splunk Observability Cloud, navigate to Splunk Synthetic Monitoring. 
#. Under Tests, select :guilabel:`Add new test` and select :guilabel:`API test` from the list. The test creation view opens. 
#. In the :guilabel:`Name` field, enter a name for your test. 
#. Beside :guilabel:`Steps`, select :guilabel:`Add requests` to add requests to your API test. The requests setup page opens. 
#. Add as many requests as you would like to include in your test, including setup and validation steps. 
#. As you build your test, you can use :guilabel:`Try now` to check that the configuration of your test is valid. Try now results are ephemeral and don’t impact persisted run metrics. For more, see :ref:`try-now`. 
#. (Optional) Turn on automatic test retry in the event a test initially fails.

Auto-retry 
----------------

Run a test again automatically if it fails without any user intervention. It's a best practice to turn on auto-retry to reduce unnecessary failures from temporary interruptions like a network issue, timeouts, or other issues. Auto-retry runs do not impact subscription usage, only the completed run result counts towards your subscription usage. Auto-retry requires at least runner version 0.9.29.


Custom properties
----------------------
Add custom properties in the test creation page in advanced settings. Use key-value pairs to create custom properties to filter and group dashboards, charts, and create alerts. A list of suggested custom properties is available for each test based on the tags associated with your test. For example: ``env:test``, ``role:developer``, ``product:rum``. When you have multiple key-value pairs the logic is AND among the results. So in this case, the results show all tests for the RUM product with a developer role in the environment test.

    :alt: This image shows two custom property key value pairs, env:prod and role:developer. 

Custom properties are single-valued and don’t support multiple values, like ``region:eu, us``. For each test, you can only use one and unique key. For example, you can have ``env1:test`` and ``env:test`` in the same test, but you can't have ``env:test``, and ``env:prod``. 


Key requirements:

   * Keys must start with an uppercase or lowercase letter. Keys can't start with special characters or numbers. 
   * The remainder of the key can contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens.
   * Keys can’t be named ``test_id`` or ``test``.
   * Key size can't exceed 128 characters. 

   See, :ref:`custom-properties`. 


Add requests to your API test
------------------------------------

Follow these steps to add requests to your API test:

#. Enter a name for your first request, such as "Request Auth Token".
#. In the :guilabel:`Setup` section, use the selectors to add as many setup steps as you want to include. See :ref:`api-test` to learn more about your options.
#. In the :guilabel:`Request` section, choose a method for your request. 
#. Enter the URL for your request, including ``http`` or ``https``.
#. (Optional) To add a request header, select the ``+`` button labeled :guilabel:`Request Headers` and enter the type and content. Requests can include multiple headers.
#. In the :guilabel:`Validation` section, enter any validation steps you want to use to validate the request and response.
#. (Optional) Select :guilabel:`+ Request` to add another request to your test. 
#. Repeat until you have added as many requests as you'd like to include in your API test.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save steps & return to test` to finish creating your test.
