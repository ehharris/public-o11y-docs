   :description: Configure the Splunk Observability Cloud real user monitoring / RUM instrumentation for your iOS applications.

You can configure the iOS RUM library from the Splunk OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for iOS to add custom attributes, adapt the instrumentation to your environment and application, customize sampling, and more.

To configure the iOS RUM library, pass the settings as methods when initializating the ``SplunkRum`` module. The Splunk Observability Cloud realm and RUM token are passed as arguments to the ``SplunkRumBuilder`` function.

The following example shows how to configure the RUM token, realm, environment name, app name, and other settings:

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: swift

      import SplunkOtel
      //..
      SplunkRumBuilder(realm: "<realm>", rumAuth: "<rum-token>")
        // Call functions to configure additional options
        .debug(enabled: true)
        .globalAttributes(globalAttributes: ["strKey": "strVal", "intKey": 7, "doubleKey": 1.5, "boolKey": true])
        .deploymentEnvironment(environment: "env")
        .setApplicationName("<your_app_name>")
        .ignoreURLs(ignoreURLs: try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: ".*ignore_this.*"))
        .screenNameSpans(enabled: true)
        // The build method always come last
        .build()

   .. code-tab:: objective-c

      @import SplunkOtel;
      //...

      SplunkRumBuilder *builder = [[SplunkRumBuilder alloc] initWithBeaconUrl:@"https://rum-ingest.<realm>.signalfx.com/v1/rum"  rumAuth: @"<rum-token>"]];
      [builder globalAttributesWithGlobalAttributes:[NSDictionary dictionary]];
      [builder debugWithEnabled:true];
      [builder deploymentEnvironmentWithEnvironment:@"environment-name"];
      [builder setApplicationName:@"<your_app_name>"];
      NSError* error = nil;
      [builder ignoreURLsWithIgnoreURLs: [NSRegularExpression regularExpressionWithPattern: @".*ignore_this.*" options: 0 error: &error]];
      [builder screenNameSpansWithEnabled:true];
      // The build method always come last
      [builder build];

General settings
======================================================

Use the following settings to configure the iOS RUM library:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - :code:`realm`
     - The name of your organization's realm, for example, ``us0``. To find your Splunk realm, see :ref:`Note about realms <about-realms>`.
   * - :code:`rumAuth`
     - RUM token that authorizes the agent to send telemetry data to Splunk Observability Cloud. To generate a RUM access token, see :ref:`rum-access-token`.
   * - :code:`beaconUrl`
     - Ingest URL to which the agent sends collected telemetry. The URL must contain your realm in Splunk Observability Cloud. For example, ``https://rum-ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v1/rum`` is the ingest URL for the ``us0`` realm. When defined, it overrides the value in ``realm``.
   * - :code:`globalAttributes`
     - Sets additional attributes added to all spans. Attributes are defined as an array of comma-separated key-value pairs. For example: ``["key1":"value1","key2":3]``. See :ref:`ios-rum-globalattributes`.
   * - :code:`environment`
     - Environment for all the spans produced by the application. For example, ``dev``, ``test``, or ``prod``.
   * - :code:`appName`
     - Sets the application name. If not set, the library uses the bundle name instead. Default value is nil.

.. _ios-rum-features:

iOS RUM features
======================================================

Use the following settings to configure the behavior of iOS RUM instrumentation:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - :code:`ignoreURLs`
     - Regular expression pattern that matches URLs you want to ignore when reporting HTTP activity.
   * - :code:`spanFilter`
     - Closure of type ``((SpanData) -> SpanData?)?`` to modify or ignore spans. See :ref:`ios-rum-span-filtering`.
   * - :code:`sessionSamplingRatio`
     - Percentage of sessions to sample. Expressed as a proportion in the range ``0.0`` to ``1.0``. The default value is ``1.0``.
   * - :code:`allowInsecureBeacon`
     - If set to ``true``, this setting allows beacon URLs that use the HTTP protocol. The default value is ``false``. ``allowInsecureBeacon`` is deprecated in Splunk RUM as of February 4, 2025. Although this setting continues to function, it will be removed in a future version. 
   * - :code:`enableDiskCache`
     - Activates caching of exported spans. All spans are written to local storage and deleted after a successful export. The default value is ``false``. This setting is deprecated in Splunk RUM as of February 4, 2025. Although this setting continues to function, it will be removed in a future version. There is no replacement for this annotation. 
   * - :code:`spanDiskCacheMaxSize`
     - Threshold, in megabytes, from which spans start to be dropped from the disk cache. The oldest spans are dropped first. Only applicable when disk caching is activated. The default value is ``25`` megabytes. This setting is deprecated in Splunk RUM as of February 4, 2025. Although this setting continues to function, it will be removed in a future version. There is no replacement for this annotation. 
   * - :code:`bspScheduleDelay`
     - Sets the maximum interval between two consecutive span exports. The default value is 5 seconds. This setting is deprecated in Splunk RUM as of February 4, 2025. Although this setting continues to function, it will be removed in a future version. There is no replacement for this annotation. 
   * - :code:`slowRenderingDetectionEnabled`
     - Activates the slow rendering detection feature. The default value is ``true``. See :ref:`ios-slow-rendering-data`.
   * - :code:`slowFrameDetectionThresholdMs`
     - Optional setting that tags as slow all frames that took more than the specified time, in milliseconds. The default value is ``16.7`` milliseconds.
   * - :code:`frozenFrameDetectionThresholdMs`
     - Optional setting that tags as frozen all frames that took more than the specified time, in milliseconds. The default value is ``700`` milliseconds.
   * - :code:`debug`
     - Activates debug logging. The default value is ``false``.

.. _ios-rum-instrumentation-settings:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - :code:`showVCInstrumentation`
     - Activates the creation of spans for ``ViewController Show`` events. The default value is ``true``.
   * - :code:`screenNameSpans`
     - Activates the creation of spans for changes to the screen name. The default value is ``true``.
   * - :code:`networkInstrumentation`
     - Activates the creation of spans for network activities. The default value is ``true``.
