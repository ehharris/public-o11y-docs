   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the processlist monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics

The :ref:`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` uses the :ref:`Smart Agent receiver <smartagent-receiver>` with the
``processlist`` monitor type to report the running processes for a host, similar to the output of the ``top`` or ``ps`` commands on \*nix
systems. The output format is a special base64-encoded event that appears under the Infrastructure view for a specific host. 

After you turn this integration on, you'll be able to monitor host metrics in Splunk Observability Cloud. Learn how at :ref:`infrastructure-hosts`. Splunk Observability Cloud doesn't retain historical process information.

This integration is available on Linux and Windows.

.. note:: Instrumentation adds overhead and can cause increases in response time. To learn more, see :new-page:`How to think about instrumentation overhead <https://community.splunk.com/t5/Product-News-Announcements/Observability-How-to-Think-About-Instrumentation-Overhead-White/ba-p/670727>`.

Example
~~~~~~~

To activate this integration, add the following to your Collector
configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/processlist:
       type: processlist
       ...  # Additional config

Next, add the monitor to the ``service.pipelines.logs.receivers``
section of your configuration file. The following example shows how to
configure the ``logs`` pipeline using the required ``signalfx``
exporter:

.. code:: yaml

   service:
     pipelines:
       logs/signalfx:
         receivers: [signalfx, smartagent/processlist]
         exporters: [signalfx]
         processors: [memory_limiter, batch, resourcedetection]

Metrics
-------

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector does not do any
built-in filtering of metrics for this monitor.
