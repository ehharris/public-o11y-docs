MySQL (deprecated)
=====================

.. meta::
   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the MySQL monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics.

.. caution:: 
   
   The MySQL monitor is now deprecated and will reach of End of Support on October 31st, 2024. During this period only critical security and bug fixes are provided. When End of Support is reached, the monitor will be removed and no longer be supported, and you won't be able to use it to send data to Splunk Observability Cloud. 

   To monitor your MySQL databases you can use the native OpenTelemetry MySQL receiver instead. See :ref:`MySQL receiver <mysql-receiver>` to learn more. 

The :ref:`Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` uses the :ref:`Smart Agent receiver <smartagent-receiver>` with the MySQL monitor type to retrieve metrics and logs from MySQL.

This monitor connects to a MySQL instance and reports on the values
returned by a ``SHOW STATUS`` command, which include the following:

-  Number of commands processed
-  Table and row operations (handlers)
-  State of the query cache
-  Status of MySQL threads
-  Network traffic

This integration is only available on Kubernetes and Linux.

Creating a MySQL user for this monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a MySQL user for this monitor, run the following commands:

.. code:: sql

    CREATE USER '<username>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
    -- Give appropriate permissions
    -- ("GRANT USAGE" is synonymous to "no privileges")
    GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO '<username>'@'localhost';
    -- Permissions for the stats options
    GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO '<username>'@'localhost';

The new user only has enough privileges to connect to the database. Additional privileges are not required.

.. note:: If you want to define seperate DB names to connect to, then you have to grant at least SELECT permission to the user.


.. code:: sql

    GRANT SELECT ON <db_name>.* TO '<user_name>'@'localhost';


Considerations on localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For connections to ``localhost``, MySQL programs attempt to connect to
the local server by using a Unix socket file. To ensure that the client
makes a TCP/IP connection to the local server specify a host name value
of ``127.0.0.1``, or the IP address or name of the local server.

Example
~~~~~~~

To activate this integration, add the following to your Collector
configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/mysql:
       type: collectd/mysql
       host: 127.0.0.1
       port: 3306
       username: <global-username-for-all-db>
       password: <global-password-for-all-db>
       databases:
         - name: <name-of-db>
           username: <username> #Overrides global username
           password: <password> #Overrides global password

The following is a sample YAML configuration that shows how to connect
multiple MySQL databases:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/mysql:
       type: collectd/mysql
       host: 127.0.0.1
       port: 3306
       databases:
         - name: <name>
           username: <username>
           password: <password>
         - name: <name>
           username: <username>
           password: <password>

Next, add the monitor to the ``service.pipelines.metrics.receivers``
section of your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

   service:
     pipelines:
       metrics:
         receivers: [smartagent/mysql]

Configuration settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``host``
      - Yes
      - ``string``
      - Hostname or IP address of the MySQL instance. For example,
         ``127.0.0.1``.
   - 

      - ``port``
      - Yes
      - ``integer``
      - The port of the MySQL instance. For example, ``3306``.
   - 

      - ``databases``
      - Yes
      - ``list of objects``
      - A list of databases along with optional authentication
         credentials.
   - 

      - ``username``
      - No
      - ``string``
      - Username for all databases. You can override it by defining each
         username in the ``databases`` object.
   - 

      - ``password``
      - No
      - ``string``
      - Password for all databases. You can override it by defining each
         username in the ``databases`` object.
   - 

      - ``reportHost``
      - No
      - ``bool``
      - When set to ``true``, the ``host`` dimension is set to the name
         of the MySQL database host. When ``false``, the monitor uses
         the global ``hostname`` configuration instead. The default
         value is ``false``. When ``disableHostDimensions`` is set to
         ``true``, the host name in which the agent or monitor is
         running is not used for the ``host`` metric dimension value.
   - 

      - ``innodbStats``
      - No
      - ``bool``
      - Collects InnoDB statistics. Before activating InnoDB metrics
         make sure that you granted the ``PROCESS`` privilege to your
         user. The default value is ``false``.

The nested ``databases`` configuration object has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required

   - 

      - ``username``
      - No
      - ``string``
      - Username of the database.
