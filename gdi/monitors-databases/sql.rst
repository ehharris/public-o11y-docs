   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the SQL monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics

.. caution:: Smart Agent monitors are being deprecated. To collect SQL metrics use the native OpenTelemetry :ref:`sqlquery-receiver` component.

The SQL monitor gathers database usage metrics from SQL queries on your databases. It's available for Kubernetes, Windows, and Linux.

   - 

      - ``logQueries``
      - No
      - ``bool``
      - (default: ``false``) If true, log query results infolevel.

The nested ``queries`` configuration object has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option

   - 

      - ``query``
      - Yes
      - ``string``
      - An SQL query text that selects one or more rows from a database.
   - 

      - ``params``
      - No
      - ``list of values``
      - Optional parameters that replace placeholders in the query
         string.
   - 

      - ``metrics``
      - No
      - ``list of objects (see below)``
      - Metrics generated from the query.
   - 

      - ``datapointExpressions``
      - No
      - ``list of strings``
      - A set of expressions that convert each row to a set of metrics.
         Each of these run for each row in the query result set,
         allowing you to generate multiple data points per row. Each
         expression must evaluate to a single data point or nil.

The nested ``metrics`` configuration object has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option

      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``metricName``
      - Yes
      - ``string``
      - The name of the metric as it appears in Splunk Observability
         Cloud.
   - 

      - ``valueColumn``
      - Yes
      - ``string``
      - The column name that holds the data point value.
   - 

      - ``dimensionColumns``
      - No
      - ``list of strings``

      - ``bool``
      - Whether the value is a cumulative counters (true) or gauge
         (false). If you set this to the wrong value and send in your
         first data point for the metric name with the wrong type, you
         have to manually change the type, as it is set in the system
         based on the first type seen. The default value is ``false``.
   - 

      - ``dimensionPropertyColumns``
      - No
      - ``map of lists``
      - Mapping between dimensions and the columns to be used to attach
         corresponding properties.

Supported drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must specify the ``dbDriver`` option that contains the name of the
database driver to use. These names are the same as the name of the
Golang SQL driver used in the agent. The monitor formats the
``connectionString`` according to the driver you specify.

.. note:: Please be sure to use the correct connection string syntax based on the driver you're using. For example, if you use the ``mysql`` driver, you must use the connection string syntax for the ``mysql`` driver.

This is the list of the drivers currently supported:

-  hana.
-  sqlserver.
-  mysql.
-  postgres.
-  pq.
-  snowflake.

Parameterized connection string
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integration treats the value of ``connectionString`` as a Golang
template with a context consisting of the variables ``host`` and
``port`` and all the parameters from the ``params`` option. To add a
variable to the template, use the Golang ``{{.varname}}`` template
syntax.

See the following example:

.. code:: yaml

   smartagent/sql:
     type: sql
     host: localhost
     port: 1433
     dbDriver: sqlserver
     connectionString: 'Server=127.0.0.1;Database=WideWorldImporters;User Id=sa;Password=123456;'
     queries: 
       - query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM Sales.Orders'
         metrics:
           - metricName: "orders"
             valueColumn: "count"

Collect Snowflake performance and usage metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure the agents to collect Snowflake performance and usage
metrics, do the following:

1. Copy the ``pkg/sql/snowflake-metrics.yaml`` file from the ``sql``
   monitor repo into the same location as your ``agent.yaml`` file. For
   example, ``/etc/splunk``. Find the latest version of
   ``snowflake-metrics.yaml`` in our GitHub repo.
2. Configure the SQL monitor as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/sql:
       type: sql
       intervalSeconds: 3600
       dbDriver: snowflake
       params:
         account: "account.region"
         database: "SNOWFLAKE"
         schema: "ACCOUNT_USAGE"
         role: "ACCOUNTADMIN"
         user: "user"
         password: "password"
       connectionString: "{{.user}}:{{.password}}@{{.account}}/{{.database}}/{{.schema}}?role={{.role}}"
       queries:
         {"#from": "/etc/signalfx/snowflake-metrics.yaml"}

You can also copy the contents of ``snowflake-metrics.yaml`` into
``agent.yaml`` under ``queries``. Edit ``snowflake-metrics.yaml`` to
only include the metrics you want to monitor.

Using the monitor
-----------------

Consider the following ``customers`` database table:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - id
      - name
      - country
      - status
   - 

      - 1
      - Bill
      - USA
      - active
   - 

      - 2
      - Mary
      - USA
      - inactive
   - 

      - 3
      - Joe
      - USA
      - active
   - 

      - 4
      - Elizabeth
      - Germany
      - active

Use the following monitor configuration to generate metrics about active
users and customer counts by country:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/sql:
       type: sql
       host: localhost
       port: 5432
       dbDriver: postgres
       params:
         user: "${env:SQL_USERNAME}"
         password: "${env:SQL_PASSWORD}"
       # The `host` and `port` values shown in this example (also provided through autodiscovery) are interpolated
       # to the connection string as appropriate for the database driver.
       # Also, the values from the `params` configuration option above can be
       # interpolated.
       connectionString: 'host={{.host}} port={{.port}} dbname=main user={{.user}} password={{.password}} sslmode=disable'
       queries:
         - query: 'SELECT COUNT(*) as count, country, status FROM customers GROUP BY country, status;'
           metrics:
             - metricName: "customers"
               valueColumn: "count"
               dimensionColumns: ["country", "status"]

When you use this configuration, you get series of MTS, all with the
metric name ``customers``. Each MTS has a ``county`` and ``status``
dimension. The dimension value is the number of customers that belong to
that combination of ``country`` and ``status``. You can also specify
multiple ``metrics`` items to generate more than one metric from a
single query.

Using metric expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to do more complex logic than mapping columns to metric
values and dimensions, use the ``datapointExpressions`` option that's
available for individual metric configurations. Create more
sophisticated logic to derive data points from individual rows by using
the ``expr`` expression language. These expressions must evaluate to
data points created by the ``GAUGE`` or ``CUMULATIVE`` helper functions
available in the expression's context. You can also have the expression
evaluate to ``nil`` if you don't need to generate a data point for a
particular row.

Both the ``GAUGE`` and ``CUMULATIVE`` functions have the following
signature:

(``metricName``, ``dimensions``, ``value``)

-  ``metricName``: Must be a string
-  ``dimensions``: Must be a map of string keys and values, and
-  ``value``: Must be a numeric value.

Each of the columns in the row maps to a variable in the context of the
expression with the same name. For example, if you have a column called
``name`` in your SQL query result, you can use a variable called
``name`` in the expression. In your expression, surround string values
with single quotes (``''``).
