   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Apache ActiveMQ monitor type. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics.

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector uses the Smart Agent receiver with the
Apache ActiveMQ monitor type to track the following information from
ActiveMQ:

-  Broker (Totals per broker)
-  Queue (Queue status)
-  Topic (Topic status)

This integration is only available on Kubernetes and Linux.

This integration works with ActiveMQ 5.8.0 and higher.

Example
~~~~~~~

To activate this integration, add the following to your Collector
configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/activemq:
       type: collectd/activemq
       ...  # Additional config

Next, add the monitor to the ``service.pipelines.metrics.receivers``
section of your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   service:
     pipelines:
       metrics:
         receivers: [smartagent/activemq]

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table shows the configuration options for this
integration:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``host``
      - **yes**
      - ``string``
      - Host to connect to. JMX must be configured for remote access and
         accessible from the agent.
   - 

      - ``port``
      - **yes**
      - ``integer``
      - JMX connection port (NOT the RMI port) on the application. This
         corresponds to the ``com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`` Java
         property that should be set on the JVM when running the
         application.
   - 

      - ``name``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - 
   - 

      - ``serviceName``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - This is how the service type is identified in the Splunk
         Splunk Observability Cloud UI so that you can get built-in content for
         it. For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you
         like.
   - 

      - ``serviceURL``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - The JMX connection string. This is rendered as a Go template and
         has access to the other values in this configuration. **Note**:
         Under normal circumstances, it is not advised to set this
         string directly. Setting the host and port as specified above
         is preferred. (**default:**
         ``service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi``)
   - 

      - ``instancePrefix``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Prefixes the generated plugin instance with prefix. If a second
         ``instancePrefix`` is specified in a referenced MBean block,
         the prefix specified in the Connection block will appear at the
         beginning of the plugin instance and the prefix specified in
         the MBean block will be appended to it.
   - 

      - ``username``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Username to authenticate to the server
   - 

      - ``password``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - User password to authenticate to the server
   - 

      - ``customDimensions``
      - no
      - ``map of strings``
      - Takes in key-value pairs of custom dimensions at the connection
         level.
   - 

      - ``mBeansToCollect``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - A list of the MBeans defined in ``mBeanDefinitions`` to actually
         collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be
         collected.
   - 

      - ``mBeansToOmit``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - A list of the MBeans to omit. This will come in handy in cases
         where only a few MBeans need to be omitted from the default
         list.
   - 

      - ``mBeanDefinitions``
      - no
      - ``map of objects (see below)``
      - Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics. If using a
         specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq,
         they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you
         add in this option will be merged with those. To learn more, see the :new-page:`Collectd documentation <https://www.collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.html>`.

The **nested** ``mBeanDefinitions`` configuration object has the
following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``objectName``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Sets the pattern that is used to retrieve MBeans from the
         MBeanServer. If more than one MBean is returned, you should use
         the ``instanceFrom`` option to make the identifiers unique.
   - 

      - ``instancePrefix``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Prefixes the generated plugin instance with prefix.
   - 

      - ``instanceFrom``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - The object names used by JMX to identify MBeans include
         so-called “properties” that are basically key-value pairs. If
         the given object name is not unique and multiple MBeans are
         returned, the values of those properties usually differ. You
         can use this option to build the plugin instance from the
         appropriate property values. This option is optional and can be
         repeated to generate the plugin instance from multiple property
         values.
   - 

      - ``values``
      - no
      - ``list of objects (see below)``
      - The ``value`` blocks map one or more attributes of an MBean to a
         value list in the agent. There must be at least one ``value``
         block within each MBean block
   - 

      - ``dimensions``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - 

The **nested** ``values`` configuration object has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``type``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Sets the data set used within the agent to handle the values of
         the MBean attribute.
   - 

      - ``table``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - Set this to ``true`` if the returned attribute is a composite
         type. If set to ``true``, the keys within the composite type
         are appended to the type instance. (**default:** ``false``)
   - 

      - ``instancePrefix``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Works like the option of the same name directly beneath the
         MBean block, but sets the type instance instead.
   - 

      - ``instanceFrom``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - Works like the option of the same name directly beneath the
         MBean block, but sets the type instance instead.
   - 

      - ``attribute``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Sets the name of the attribute to read the value from. You can
         access the keys of composite types by using a dot to
         concatenate the key name to the attribute name. For example:
         “attrib0.key42”. If ``table`` is set to ``true``, path must
         point to a composite type, otherwise it must point to a numeric
         type.
   - 

      - ``attributes``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - The plural form of the ``attribute`` config above. Used to
         derive multiple metrics from a single MBean.
