   monitors-monitoring/jaeger-grpc
   monitors-monitoring/nagios
   monitors-monitoring/signalfx-forwarder
   monitors-monitoring/win_perf_counters

These application receivers gather metrics from their associated monitoring applications and the hosts the applications are running on.

* :ref:`cadvisor`
* :ref:`cgroups`
* :ref:`Istio <get-started-istio>`
* :ref:`jaeger-grpc`
* :ref:`nagios`
* :ref:`signalfx-forwarder`
* :ref:`telegraf-win-perf-counters`

These exporters determine where to send the received data.
