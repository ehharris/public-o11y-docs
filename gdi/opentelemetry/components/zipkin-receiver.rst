      :description: The Zipkin receiver receives spans from Zipkin versions 1 and 2.

The Zipkin receiver gathers spans from Zipkin versions 1 and 2. The supported pipeline type is ``traces``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

Get started
======================

.. note:: 
  
  This component is included in the default configuration of the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector when deploying in host monitoring (agent) mode. See :ref:`otel-deployment-mode` for more information. 
  
  For details about the default configuration, see :ref:`otel-kubernetes-config`, :ref:`linux-config-ootb`, or :ref:`windows-config-ootb`. You can customize your configuration any time as explained in this document.

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:

  - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
  - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
  - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the Zipkin receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configuration
--------------------------------

To activate the Zipkin receiver, add ``zipkin`` to the ``receivers`` section of your configuration file, as in the following sample configurations. 

.. code-block:: yaml

  receivers:
    zipkin:
      endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9412

To complete the configuration, include the receiver in the ``traces`` pipeline of the ``service`` section of your configuration file. For example:

.. code:: yaml

  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [zipkin]              

The following settings are configurable:

* ``endpoint``: ``host:port`` on which the receiver is going to receive data. ``0.0.0.0:9411`` by default.
* ``parse_string_tags``: If enabled, the receiver attempts to parse string tags or binary annotations into int/bool/float. ``false`` by default.

Additional settings
--------------------------------

The Zipkin receiver uses helper files for additional capabilities:

* HTTP settings, including CORS. See more in GitHub at :new-page:`HTTP Configuration Settings <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/confighttp/README.md#server-configuration>`
* TLS and mTLS settings. Learn more in GitHub at :new-page:`TLS Configuration Settings <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md>`.
