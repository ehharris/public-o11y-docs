      :description: The MongoDB Atlas receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics from MongoDB Atlas through its monitoring API.

The MongoDB Atlas receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect metrics and logs from MongoDB Atlas through its monitoring API. The supported pipeline types are ``metrics`` and ``logs``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

Database metrics are dimensionalized by project and database attributes, for example, ``project_name`` and
``database_name``.

.. note:: Use the MongoDB Atlas receiver in place of the deprecated SignalFx Smart Agent ``mongodb-atlas`` monitor type.

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
   - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
   - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the MongoDB Atlas receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configurations
----------------------

To activate the MongoDB Atlas receiver, add ``mongodbatlas`` to the ``receivers`` section of your
configuration file, as shown in the following example:

.. code:: yaml

   # In this example, both values are pulled from the environment.

   receivers:
     mongodbatlas:
       public_key: ${MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY}
       # You can obtain the public key from the API Keys tab of the MongoDB Atlas Project Access Manager. 
       # This value is required.
       private_key: ${MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY}
       # You can obtain the private key from the API Keys tab of the MongoDB Atlas Project Access Manager. 
       # This value is required.

The following example shows how to collect logs:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
       mongodbatlas:
        logs:
          enabled: true
          projects: 
            - name: "Your MongoDB project"
              collect_audit_logs: true
              collect_host_logs: true

To complete the configuration, include the receiver in the ``metrics`` or ``logs`` pipelines of the ``service`` section of your configuration file. For example:

.. code:: yaml

   service:
     pipelines:
       metrics:
         receivers: [mongodbatlas]
      logs:
         receivers: [mongodbatlas]

.. note:: To access Audit and Host logs, the API key must have the Project Data Access Read Only or higher role.
