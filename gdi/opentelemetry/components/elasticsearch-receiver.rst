      :description: The Elasticsearch receiver queries the Elasticsearch node stats, cluster health and index stats endpoints in order to scrape metrics from a running Elasticsearch cluster.

The Elasticsearch receiver queries Elasticsearch's node stats, cluster health and index stats endpoints to scrape metrics from a running Elasticsearch cluster. The supported pipeline type is ``metrics``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

.. note:: Out-of-the-box dashboards and navigators aren't supported for the Elasticsearch receiver yet, but are planned for a future release.

To learn more about the queried endpoints see:

* :new-page:`Nodes stats API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html>`
* :new-page:`Cluster health API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-health.html>`
* :new-page:`Index stats API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html>`

Prerequisites
======================

This receiver supports Elasticsearch versions 7.9 or higher.

If Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have either the monitor or manage cluster privilege. See Elasticsearch's :new-page:`Role-based access control <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/authorization.html>` and :new-page:`Security privileges <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-privileges.html>` for more information on authorization and security privileges.

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:

  - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
  - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
  - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the Elasticsearch receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configuration
--------------------------------

To activate the receiver, add ``elasticsearch`` to the ``receivers`` section of your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

  receivers:
      elasticsearch:

Next, include the receiver in the ``metrics`` pipeline of the ``service`` section of your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

  service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers:
          - elasticsearch

Advanced configuration
-----------------------------------------------

The following settings are optional:

* ``nodes``. ``["_all"]`` by default. Allows you to specify node filters that define which nodes are scraped for node-level and cluster-level metrics. 

  * See Elasticsearch's :new-page:`Cluster APIs Node specification <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/cluster.html#cluster-nodes>` for allowed filters. 
  
  * If empty, then the receiver doesn't scrape any node-level metrics, and only metrics related to the cluster's health are scraped at the cluster level.

* ``skip_cluster_metrics``. ``false`` by default. If ``true``, cluster-level metrics are not scraped.

* ``indices``. ``["_all"]`` by default. Allows you to specify index filters that define which indices are scraped for index-level metrics. 

  * See Elasticsearch's :new-page:`Cluster APIs Path parameters <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html#index-stats-api-path-params>` for allowed filters.   
  
  * If empty, then the receiver doesn't scrape any index-level metrics.

* ``endpoint``. ``http://localhost:9200`` by default. The base URL of the Elasticsearch API for the cluster to monitor.

* ``username``. No default. Specifies the username used to authenticate with Elasticsearch using basic auth. 

* ``password``. No default. Specifies the password used to authenticate with Elasticsearch using basic auth. 

* ``collection_interval``. ``10s`` by default. This receiver collects metrics on an interval determined by this setting. This value must be a string readable by Golang's :new-page:`time.ParseDuration <https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration>`. 
  
  * On larger clusters, you might need to increase this interval, as querying Elasticsearch for metrics takes longer on clusters with more nodes.

* ``initial_delay``. ``1s`` by default. Defines how long this receiver waits before starting.

Configuration example
-----------------------------------------------

See the following configuration example:

.. code:: yaml

  receivers:
    elasticsearch:
      metrics:
        elasticsearch.node.fs.disk.available:
          enabled: false
      nodes: ["_local"]
      skip_cluster_metrics: true
      indices: [".geoip_databases"]
      endpoint: http://localhost:9200
      username: otel
      password: password
      collection_interval: 10s
