      :description: The Jaeger receiver gathers trace data in Jaeger format.

The Jaeger receiver gathers trace data in Jaeger format. The supported pipeline type is ``traces``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

Get started
======================

.. note:: 
  
  This component is included in the default configuration of the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector when deploying in host monitoring (agent) mode. See :ref:`otel-deployment-mode` for more information. 
  
  For details about the default configuration, see :ref:`otel-kubernetes-config`, :ref:`linux-config-ootb`, or :ref:`windows-config-ootb`. You can customize your configuration any time as explained in this document.

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:

  - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
  - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
  - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the Jaeger receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configurations
--------------------------------

To activate the Jaeger receiver, add ``jaeger`` to the ``receivers`` section of your configuration file, as in the following sample configurations. By default, the Jaeger receiver doesn't serve any protocol. You must name a protocol under the ``protocols`` object to start the receiver. 

See :ref:`jaeger-receiver-settings` for more details.

.. code-block:: yaml


  receivers:
    jaeger:
      protocols:
        grpc:
    jaeger/withendpoint:
      protocols:
        grpc:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:14260

Supported protocols
-----------------------------------------------

The Jaeger receiver supports the following protocols: 

* ``grpc``. ``0.0.0.0:14250`` is the default endpoint.
* ``thrift_binary``. ``0.0.0.0:6832`` is the default endpoint.
* ``thrift_compact``. ``0.0.0.0:6831`` is the default endpoint.
* ``thrift_http``. ``0.0.0.0:14268`` is the default endpoint.

Optionally, you can configure an ``endpoint``.

Advanced configuration
-----------------------------------------------

Use the UDP protocols, currently ``thrift_binary`` and ``thrift_compact``, to set additional server options:

* ``queue_size``:  Sets the maximum of not yet handled requests for the server. ``1000`` by default.
* ``max_packet_size``: Sets the maximum UDP packet size. ``65_000`` by default.
* ``workers``: Sets the number of workers consuming the server queue. ``10`` by default.
* ``socket_buffer_size``: Sets the buffer size of the connection socket, in bytes. ``0`` by default (no buffer). 

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml


  protocols:
    thrift_binary:
      endpoint: 0.0.0.0:6832
      queue_size: 5_000
      max_packet_size: 131_072
      workers: 50
      socket_buffer_size: 8_388_608

Additional settings 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Jaeger receiver uses helper files for additional capabilities:

* gRPC settings, including CORS. See more in GitHub at :new-page:`gRPC Configuration Settings <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configgrpc/README.md>`
* TLS and mTLS settings. Learn more in GitHub at :new-page:`TLS Configuration Settings <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/config/configtls/README.md>`.

Remote sampling
-----------------------------------------------

Since version 0.61.0, remote sampling is no longer supported. Instead, since version 0.59.0, use the ``jaegerremotesampling`` extension for remote sampling.
