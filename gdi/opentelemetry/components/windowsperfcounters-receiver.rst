      :description: The Windows Performance Counters receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect system, application, or custom performance counter data from the Windows Registry.

The Windows Performance Counters receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect configured system, application, or custom performance counter data from the Windows Registry. The supported pipeline type is ``metrics``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

.. note:: The Windows Performance Counters receiver only works on Windows hosts.

The Windows Performance Counters receiver replaces the Smart Agent monitor :ref:`telegraf-win-perf-counters`. It's based on the :new-page:`Telegraf Windows Performance Counters Input Plugin <https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters>` and uses the :new-page:`PDH interface <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/perfctrs/using-the-pdh-functions-to-consume-counter-data>`. 

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your Windows host platform as described in :ref:`otel-install-windows`.
2. Configure the Windows Performance Counters receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configuration
----------------------

To activate the Windows Performance Counters receiver add a ``windowsperfcounters`` entry inside the ``receivers`` section of the Collector configuration file. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  receivers:
    windowsperfcounters:
      metrics:
        bytes.committed:
          description: the number of bytes committed to memory
          unit: By
          gauge:
      collection_interval: 30s
      perfcounters:
      - object: Memory
        counters:
          - name: Committed Bytes
            metric: bytes.committed

To complete the configuration, include the receiver in the ``metrics`` pipeline of the ``service`` section of your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers:
          - windowsperfcounters

To collect metrics from Windows performance counters, you need to define metrics using the ``metrics`` field as in the example. You can then reference the metrics you defined from the ``counters.metric`` fields.

View available performance counters
============================================

To see a list of available performance counters, use Windows PowerShell or the Windows Performance Monitor.

.. tabs:: 
  
  .. tab:: PowerShell

    In PowerShell, run the following command to list all performance counter sets:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      Get-Counter -ListSet *

    To list the instances of each performance counter set, run the following command and replace ``<perf_object_name>`` with the name of the instances you want to find:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      Get-Counter -List "<perf_object_name>"
    
  .. tab:: Windows Performance Monitor
    
    Run the following command to open the Windows Performance Monitor:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      perfmon /sys

    In the Windows Performance Monitor, select the green plus arrow to see a list of available performance counters. 

    .. image:: /_images/gdi/windows-monitor.png
      :width: 100%
      :alt: The Add Counters screen of the Windows Performance Monitor displays a list of available Windows Performance Counters and a list of counters added to the performance monitor.

Note the following:

* If a specific performance counter can't be accessed at startup, the receiver emits a warning and continues execution. 

* Some performance counters might not exist on some systems due to different OS configuration.

Advanced configuration
============================================

Configure collection interval and counters
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can configure the collection interval and which performance counters you want to scrape. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  windowsperfcounters:
    collection_interval: <duration>
    initial_delay: <duration>
    metrics:
      <metric name 1>:
        description: <description>
        unit: <unit type>
        gauge: null
      <metric name 2>:
        description: <description>
        unit: <unit type>
        sum: null
        aggregation: <cumulative or delta>
        monotonic: <true or false>
    perfcounters:
    - object: <object name>
      instances:
        - <instance name>
      counters:
        - name: <counter name>
          metric: <metric name>
          attributes:
          <key>: <value>

Scrape at different collection intervals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to scrape performance counters using different collection intervals depending on the target:

.. code-block:: yaml

  receivers:
    windowsperfcounters/memory:
      metrics:
        bytes.committed:
          description: Number of bytes committed to memory
          unit: By
          gauge:
      collection_interval: 30s
      perfcounters:
        - object: Memory
          counters:
            - name: Committed Bytes
              metric: bytes.committed

    windowsperfcounters/processor:
      collection_interval: 1m
      metrics:
        processor.time:
          description: CPU active and idle time
          unit: "%"
          gauge:
      perfcounters:
        - object: "Processor"
          instances: "*"
          counters:
            - name: "% Processor Time"
              metric: processor.time
              attributes:
                state: active
        - object: "Processor"
          instances: ["0", "1"]
          counters:
            - name: "% Idle Time"
              metric: processor.time
              attributes:
                state: idle

    # ...

  service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers: [windowsperfcounters/memory, windowsperfcounters/processor]

Configure instances
---------------------------------

An instance is any entity that produces performance data. Instances can have one or more counter values.

The receiver supports the following values through the ``instances`` field:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40, 60
   :width: 100%

   * - Value
     - Interpretation
   * - Not specified
     - This is the only valid value if the counter has no instances     
   * - ``"*"``
     - All instances, excluding ``_Total``
   * - ``"_Total"``
     - The "total" instance, that aggregates the values of all other instances. For more information, see :ref:`total-instance-behavior`
   * - ``"instance1"``
     - Single instance
   * - ``["instance1", "instance2", ...]``
     - Set of instances
   * - ``["_Total", "instance1", "instance2", ...]``
     - Set of instances including the total instance

.. _total-instance-behavior:

Total instance behavior and the aggregation counter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To avoid dropping the ``_Total`` instance, configure the receiver to collect it individually on its own metric, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  windowsperfcounters:
    metrics:
      processor.time.total:
        description: Total CPU active and idle time
        unit: "%"
        gauge:
    collection_interval: 30s
    perfcounters:
      - object: "Processor"
        instances:
          - "_Total"
        counters:
          - name: "% Processor Time"
            metric: processor.time.total

.. warning::

  When using an ``instance`` value of ``"*"``, if the counter uses a value other than ``_Total``, make sure to avoid double counting when aggregating metrics after the receiver scrapes them.

Recreate the query on every scrape
--------------------------------------------

On some versions of Windows, Counters are sometimes corrupted and continuously return invalid data after the first scrape. If this happens, set the counter setting ``recreate_query`` to ``true`` (defaults to ``false``) to tell the receiver to recreate the PDH query on every scrape. This might affect performance but should be inconsequential unless ``collection_interval`` is very high.

If re-creating the query fails, the previous query will be re-used and an error will be logged.

Define metric format
======================

Configured metrics consist of a metric description, including unit and type, used by one or more performance counters scraped by the receiver. 

To report metrics in a specific format, define the metric and reference it in the corresponding counter, along with any applicable attributes. By default, the metric name corresponds to the name of the counter.

Metrics can be of type ``sum`` or ``gauge``. Sum metrics support the ``aggregation`` and ``monotonic`` fields.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%
   :widths: 20 40 20 20   

   - 

      - Field
      - Description
      - Value
      - Default
   - 

      - ``name``
      - Metric key or name. Can be any non empty string.
      - String
      - Name of the counter
   - 

      - ``description``
      - Description of the metric or measurement
      - String
      - 
   - 

      - ``unit``
      - Unit of measurement
      - String
      - ``1``
   - 

      - ``sum``
      - Representation of a sum metric
      - Sum configuration
      - 
   - 

      - ``gauge``
      - Representation of a gauge metric
      - Gauge configuration
      - 

Sum metrics
----------------------

The following settings apply to sum metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :width: 100%
   :widths: 25 50 25

   - 

      - Field
      - Description
      - Value
   - 

      - ``aggregation``
      - Type of aggregation temporality for the metric
      - ``cumulative`` or ``delta``
   - 

      - ``monotonic``
      - Whether the metric value can decrease
      - ``false``

Gauge metrics
----------------------

The ``gauge`` configuration doesn't accept settings. It is specified as an object for forwards compatibility.

The following example emits the ``Memory/Committed Bytes`` counter as the ``bytes.committed`` metric:

.. code:: yaml

  receivers:
    windowsperfcounters:
      metrics:
        bytes.committed:
          description: the number of bytes committed to memory
          unit: By
          gauge:
      collection_interval: 30s
      perfcounters:
      - object: Memory
        counters:
          - name: Committed Bytes
            metric: bytes.committed

  service:
    pipelines:
      metrics:
        receivers: [windowsperfcounters]

Known limitations
======================

* The network interface is not available inside the container and as a result metrics for the object ``Network Interface`` aren't generated in that scenario. If there is a sub-process it captures ``Network Interface`` metrics. 

* The counter category ``Process`` is unreliable with multiple instances of the same process. 

  * For Windows 11 and higher, use ``Process V2`` instead as it includes the process ID in the instance name. 
  
  * For versions prior to Windows 11, you can configure the ``Process`` counter category to include the PID in the instance name.
