      :description: The Splunk HEC receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to collect logs and metrics in Splunk HTTP Event Collector format.

The Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) receiver allows the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to collect events and logs in Splunk HEC format. The supported pipeline types are ``metrics`` and ``logs``. See :ref:`otel-data-processing` for more information.

The receiver accepts data formatted as JSON HEC events under any path or as end-of-line separated log raw data if sent to the ``raw_path``. See :new-page:`Format events for HTTP Event Collector <https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/FormateventsforHTTPEventCollector>` for more information.

.. note:: For information about the HEC exporter, see :ref:`splunk-hec-exporter`.

Get started
======================

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
   - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
   - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the Splunk HEC receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configuration
----------------------

To activate the Splunk HEC receiver add a ``splunk_hec`` entry inside the ``receivers`` section of the Collector configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
      splunk_hec:

To complete the configuration, include the receiver in the required pipeline of the ``service`` section of your
configuration file. For example:

.. code:: yaml

   service:
      pipelines:
         metrics:
            receivers: [splunk_hec]

Configuration example
--------------------------------------------

The following example shows a Splunk HEC receiver configured with all available settings:

.. code-block:: yaml

   receivers:
     # ...
     splunk_hec:
     # Address and port the Splunk HEC receiver should bind to
     endpoint: localhost:8088
     # Whether to preserve incoming access token
     access_token_passthrough: true
     # Path accepting raw HEC events (logs only)
     raw_path: "/foo"
     # Path reporting health checks
     health_path: "/bar"
     # Define field mappings
     hec_metadata_to_otel_attrs:
       source: "file.name"
       sourcetype: "foobar"
       index: "myindex"
       host: "myhostfield"
     # Optional TLS settings
     tls:
       # Both cert_file and
       # key_file are required
       # for TLS connections
       cert_file: /test.crt
       key_file: /test.key

Authorize HTTP requests
-----------------------------

To allow the receiver to work with client extensions, add the following in the Collector service and pipeline configuration: 

* :new-page:`Basic authentication <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/basicauthextension>`
* :new-page:`Bearer Token authentication <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/bearertokenauthextension>`
* :new-page:`OIDC Authentication <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/oidcauthextension>`
* :new-page:`OAuth 2 client <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/oauth2clientauthextension>`

For advanced users, you can implement your own authentication extension to fulfill your requirements using the :new-page:`open-telemetry auth Go package <https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/extension/auth>` and :ref:`collector-common-config-tls`.
