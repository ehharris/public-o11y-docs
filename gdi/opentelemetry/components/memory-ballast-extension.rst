Get started
======================

The Memory Ballast extension enables applications to configure memory ballast for processing.

Follow these steps to configure and activate the component:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
  
  - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
  - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
  - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the extension as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Sample configuration
--------------------------------

To activate the component, add ``memory_ballast`` to the ``extensions`` section of your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  extensions:
    memory_ballast:

To complete the configuration, include the extension in the ``service`` section of your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

  service:
    extensions: [memory_ballast]  

You can configure the following settings for the extension:

* ``size_mib``. The memory ballast size, in MiB. 

  * ``0`` by default.
  * Takes higher priority than ``size_in_percentage`` if both are specified at the same time. 
  
* ``size_in_percentage``. Sets the memory ballast based on the total memory in percentage. 

  * ``0`` by default.
  * The value can range from 1 to 100. 
  * Supported in both containerized (Docker, Kubernetes) and physical host environments.     

Configuration examples
--------------------------------

This configuration uses 64 Mib of memory for the ballast:

.. code-block:: yaml


  extensions:
    memory_ballast:
      size_mib: 64

This configuration uses 20% of the total memory for the ballast:

.. code-block:: yaml


  extensions:
    memory_ballast:
      size_in_percentage: 20

Calculate the ballast's size as a percentage
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When ``size_in_percentage`` is enabled, the value for ``ballast_size`` is calculated as follows.

On the target host or container, check the value in ``memory.limit_in_bytes`` to learn if there's any memory limitation for the running Collector process. Memory files are stores in paths such as /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes.

* If ``memory.limit_in_bytes`` is a positive value other than ``9223372036854771712`` (``0x7FFFFFFFFFFFF000``), the value for ``ballast_size`` is calculated with the formula 

  ``ballast_size`` = ``size_in_percentage`` * ``memory.limit_in_bytes`` / 100 

* If ``memory.limit_in_bytes`` is ``9223372036854771712`` (``0x7FFFFFFFFFFFF000``), no memory limit has been set for the Collector process or the running container in cgroup, and the value for ``ballast_size`` is calculated with the formula 
  
  ``ballast_size`` =  ``size_in_percentage`` * ``totalMemory`` / 100 

  where ``totalMemory`` is calculated by :new-page:`github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3/mem <https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil>` on ``mem.VirtualMemory().total``.
