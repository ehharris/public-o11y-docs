The Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector can automatically identify data sources and collect metrics and traces to send them to Splunk Observability Cloud. With automatic discovery and zero-code instrumentation you don't need to manually configure the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector or your applications before deploying them. 

The following diagram shows how automatic discovery finds data sources:

  <h3>Discovered services in the UI</h3>

If you're in a Kubernetes environment and are using the Collector version 0.109.0 or higher, log in to Splunk Observability Cloud and go to the :guilabel:`Discovered services` tab in the :guilabel:`Data Management` menu to see which of your services and third-party applications the Collector has detected and can monitor automatically.
