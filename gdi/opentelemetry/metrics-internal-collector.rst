Use internal metrics to monitor your Collector instance 
=========================================================================

You can use the Collector's :ref:`internal metrics <metrics-internal-collector-list>` to monitor the behavior of the Collector and identify performance issues.

Monitor data flow and detect data loss
------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure data is flowing correctly, use the ``otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans``, ``otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points``, and ``otelcol_receiver_accepted_logs`` metrics for information about the data ingested by the Collector, and ``otecol_exporter_sent_spans``, ``otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points``, and ``otelcol_exporter_sent_logs`` for information about exported data.

Use ``otelcol_processor_dropped_spans``, ``otelcol_processor_dropped_metric_points``, and ``otelcol_processor_dropped_logs`` to detect data loss. Small losses shouldn't be considered outages, so depending on your requirements, set up a minimal time window before alerting.

Detect receive failures
------------------------------------------------------------

Sustained rates of ``otelcol_receiver_refused_spans``, ``otelcol_receiver_refused_metric_points``, and ``otelcol_receiver_refused_logs`` indicate too many errors returned to clients. Depending on the deployment and the client's resilience this may indicate data loss at the clients.

Sustained rates of ``otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans``, ``otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points``, and ``otelcol_exporter_send_failed_logs`` indicate that the Collector is not able to export data as expected. It doesn't necessarily imply data loss since there could be retries but a high rate of failures could indicate issues with the network or the back-end receiving the data.

Control queue length
------------------------------------------------------------

Use the queue-retry mechanism (available in most exporters) as the retry mechanism for the Collector: 

To check if your queue capacity is enough, compare ``otelcol_exporter_queue_capacity``, which indicates the capacity of the retry queue in batches, and ``otelcol_exporter_queue_size``, which indicates the current size of retry queue. 

``otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_spans``, ``otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_metric_points`` and ``otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_log_records`` indicate the number of span/metric points/log records failed to be added to the sending queue. If your queue is full, decrease your sending rate or horizontally scale collectors.

The queue-retry mechanism also supports logging for monitoring. Check your logs for messages like "Dropping data because sending_queue is full".
