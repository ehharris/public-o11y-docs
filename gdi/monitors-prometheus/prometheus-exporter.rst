Prometheus Exporter
===================

.. meta::
   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Prometheus Exporter monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics

The Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector uses the Smart Agent receiver with the ``prometheus-exporter`` monitor type to read all metric types from a Prometheus Exporter endpoint.

A Prometheus Exporter is a piece of software that fetches statistics
from another, non-Prometheus system, and turns them into Prometheus
metrics. For a description of the Prometheus metric types, see Metric
Types.

This monitor is available on Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.

Example
~~~~~~~

To activate this integration, add the following to your Collector
configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     smartagent/prometheus-exporter:
       type: prometheus-exporter
       discoveryRule: port >= 9100 && port <= 9500 && container_image =~ "exporter"
       extraDimensions:
          metric_source: prometheus    
       ...  # Additional config

Next, add the monitor to the ``service.pipelines.metrics.receivers``
section of your configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

   service:
     pipelines:
       metrics:
         receivers: [smartagent/prometheus-exporter]

For specific use cases that show how the Splunk Distribution of
OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing
environments, see configuration examples.

See the Prometheus Federation Endpoint Example in GitHub for an example
of how the OTel Collector works with Splunk Enterprise and an existing
Prometheus deployment.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table shows the configuration options for the
``prometheus-exporter`` monitor:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``httpTimeout``
      - no
      - ``int64``
      - HTTP timeout duration for both read and writes. This should be a
         duration string that is accepted by func ParseDuration
   - 

      - ``username``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any.
   - 

      - ``password``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any.
   - 

      - ``useHTTPS``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - If ``true``, the agent will connect to the server using HTTPS
         instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** ``false``)
   - 

      - ``httpHeaders``
      - no
      - ``map of strings``
      - A map of HTTP header names to values. Comma separated multiple
         values for the same message-header is supported.
   - 

      - ``skipVerify``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - If useHTTPS is ``true`` and this option is also ``true``, the
         exporter TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:**
         ``false``)
   - 

      - ``caCertPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Path to the CA cert that has signed the TLS cert, unnecessary if
         ``skipVerify`` is set to ``false``.
   - 

      - ``clientCertPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Path to the client TLS cert to use for TLS required connections
   - 

      - ``clientKeyPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections
   - 

      - ``host``
      - **yes**
      - ``string``
      - Host of the exporter
   - 

      - ``port``
      - **yes**
      - ``integer``
      - Port of the exporter
   - 

      - ``useServiceAccount``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - Use pod service account to authenticate. (**default:**
         ``false``)
   - 

      - ``metricPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually
         ``/metrics`` (the default). (**default:** ``/metrics``)
   - 

      - ``sendAllMetrics``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter
         without any filtering. This option has no effect when using the
         prometheus exporter monitor directly since there is no built-in
         filtering, only when embedding it in other monitors.
         (**default:** ``false``)

Authentication
--------------

For basic HTTP authentication, use the ``username`` and ``password``
options.

On Kubernetes, if the monitored service requires authentication, use the
``useServiceAccount`` option to use the service account of the agent
when connecting. Make sure that the Smart Agent service account has
sufficient permissions for the monitored service.

Metrics
-------

There are no metrics available for this integration.

Prometheus metric conversion details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is how Prometheus metrics are converted:

-  Gauges are converted directly to Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring
   gauges.
-  Counters are converted directly to Infrastructure Monitoring
   cumulative counters.
-  Untyped metrics are converted directly to Infrastructure Monitoring
   gauges.
-  Summary metrics are converted to three distinct metrics, where
   ``<basename>`` is the root name of the metric:

   -  The total count is converted to a cumulative counter called
      ``<basename>_count``.
   -  The total sum is converted to a cumulative counter called
      ``<basename>``.
   -  Each quantile value is converted to a gauge called
      ``<basename>_quantile`` and includes a dimension called
      ``quantile`` that specifies the quantile.

-  Histogram metrics are converted to three distinct metrics, where
   ``<basename>`` is the root name of the metric:

   -  The total count is converted to a cumulative counter called
      ``<basename>_count``.
   -  The total sum is converted to a cumulative counter called
      ``<basename>``.
   -  Each histogram bucket is converted to a cumulative counter called
      ``<basename>_bucket`` and includes a dimension called
      ``upper_bound`` that specifies the maximum value in that bucket.
      This metric specifies the number of events with a value that is
      less than or equal to the upper bound.

All Prometheus labels are converted directly to Infrastructure
Monitoring dimensions.

This supports service discovery so you can set a discovery rule such as
``port >= 9100 && port <= 9500 && containerImage =~ "exporter"``,
assuming you are running exporters in container images that have the
word “exporter” in them that fall within the standard exporter port
range.

In Kubernetes, you can also try matching on the container port name as
defined in the pod spec, which is the ``name`` variable in discovery
rules for the ``k8s-api`` observer.

Filtering can be very useful here, because exporters tend to be verbose.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Log contains the error ``net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution: Activate HTTPS with ``useHTTPS``.

Log contains the error ``forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/metrics\"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution: Activate ``useServiceAccount`` and make sure the service
account that the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector is
running with has the necessary permissions.
