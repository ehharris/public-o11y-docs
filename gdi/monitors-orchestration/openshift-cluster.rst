   :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the OpenShift cluster monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector uses the Smart Agent receiver with the
``openshift-cluster`` monitor type to collect cluster-level metrics from
the Kubernetes API server, which includes all metrics from
:ref:`kubernetes-cluster` with additional OpenShift-specific
metrics. You only need to use the ``openshift-cluster`` monitor for
OpenShift deployments, as it incorporates the ``kubernetes-cluster``
monitor automatically.

This monitor is available on Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.

Behavior
---------

Since the agent is generally running in multiple places in a Kubernetes
cluster, and since it is generally more convenient to share the same
configuration across all agent instances, this monitor by default makes
use of a leader election process to ensure that it is the only agent
sending metrics in a cluster.

All of the agents running in the same namespace that have this monitor
configured decide amongst themselves which agent should send metrics for
this monitor. This agent becomes the leader agent. The remaining agents
stand by, ready to activate if the leader agent dies. You can override
leader agent election by setting the ``alwaysClusterReporter`` option to
``true``, which makes the monitor always report metrics.

Installation
----------------

Follow these steps to deploy this integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your
   host or container platform.

   By default the Collector is installed in the namespace you're logged
   into. To deploy the Collector into a different namespace, use the
   ``--namespace`` flag to indicate where to place the Collector in.

   -  :ref:`Install on Kubernetes <otel-install-k8s>` When
      installing Kubernetes using the Helm chart, use the
      ``--set distribution='openshift'`` option to generate specific
      OpenShift metrics, in addition to the standard Kubernetes metrics.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: shell

         helm install --set cloudProvider=' ' --set distribution='openshift' --set splunkObservability.accessToken='******' --set clusterName='cluster1' --namespace='namespace1' --set splunkObservability.realm='us0' --set gateway.enabled='false' --generate-name splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector``

      Find more information in our GitHub repos.

   -  :ref:`Install on Linux <otel-install-linux>`

   -  :ref:`Install on Windows <otel-install-windows>`

2. Configure the monitor, as described in the Configuration section.

3. Restart the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector.

Configuration options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``alwaysClusterReporter``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - If ``true``, leader election is skipped and metrics are always
         reported. The default value is ``false``.
   - 

      - ``namespace``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - If specified, only resources within the given namespace are
         monitored. If omitted (blank), all supported resources across
         all namespaces are monitored.
   - 

      - ``kubernetesAPI``
      - no
      - ``object``
      - Config for the K8s API client
   - 

      - ``nodeConditionTypesToReport``
      - no
      - ``list of strings``
      - A list of node status condition types to report as metrics. The metrics are reported as data points of the form ``kubernetes.node_<type_snake_cased>`` with a value of ``0`` corresponding to “False”, ``1`` to “True”, and ``-1`` to “Unknown”. The default value is ``[Ready]``.

The **nested** ``kubernetesAPI`` configuration object has the following
fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 18 18 18 18
   :header-rows: 1

   - 

      - Option
      - Required
      - Type
      - Description
   - 

      - ``authType``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - How to authenticate to the K8s API server. This can be one of
         ``none`` (for no auth), ``tls`` (to use manually specified TLS
         client certs, not recommended), ``serviceAccount`` (to use the
         standard service account token provided to the agent pod), or
         ``kubeConfig`` to use credentials from ``~/.kube/config``. The
         default value is ``serviceAccount``.
   - 

      - ``skipVerify``
      - no
      - ``bool``
      - Whether to skip verifying the TLS cert from the API server.
         Almost never needed. The default value is ``false``.
   - 

      - ``clientCertPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - The path to the TLS client cert on the pod's filesystem, if
         using ``tls`` auth.
   - 

      - ``clientKeyPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - The path to the TLS client key on the pod's filesystem, if using
         ``tls`` auth.
   - 

      - ``caCertPath``
      - no
      - ``string``
      - Path to a CA certificate to use when verifying the API server's
         TLS cert. Generally, this is provided by Kubernetes alongside
         the service account token, which is picked up automatically, so
         this should rarely be necessary to specify.
