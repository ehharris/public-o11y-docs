   :description: About the user roll in Splunk On-Call.



A virtually limitless number of scheduling options can be configured in Splunk On-Call. Two of the most common scenarios are described in the following sections.

.. note:: Only Global and Team Admins have the ability to create and edit schedules.

Scenario 1: Multiple people on-call during business hours
================================================================

Multiple people on-call during business hours. One person takes turns doing nights and weekends, One person takes turns doing 24x7 secondary coverage

Main points:

- Create a rotation called "Business Hours" with one Partial Day type shift for each user you would like on-call during Business Hours.
- Create a rotation called "Nights and Weekends" with one Partial Day type shift for the weeknights portion, and one Multi-day type shift for the weekend.
- Create a rotation called "Secondary" with a 24/7 type shift
- Make three escalation policies that use these rotations with "Notify the on duty users in rotation" actions in Step 1. Set Step 2 of the Nights and Weekends and Business Hours escalation policies to execute the Secondary escalation policy


Configure the Business Hours rotation
----------------------------------------------

#. Navigate to the team you'd like to implement this schedule for and add all of the appropriate users using the :guilabel:`Invite User` button.
#. Navigate to the :menuselection:`Rotations` tab and select :guilabel:`Add Rotation`.
#. Name the rotation "Business Hours" and select "Partial Day" for the shift type.
    #. Name the first shift either after the user who will be occupying it or just call it "Shift 1" and set the hours.
    #. Select :guilabel:`Save Shift`.
        .. note::  Ignore the "Handoff happens every X week" and "The next handoff happens X" fields because this shift is being created with the intent to not handoff.
    #. Next, add the appropriate user to this shift by selecting :guilabel:`Manage Members` and then :guilabel:`Select a User to add`.
    #. After adding the appropriate user, select :guilabel:`Add Another Shift`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Partial Day` and repeat the process from the previous steps. You will end up creating one shift for each user you would like on-call simultaneously during the business day.
#. When finished, select :guilabel:`I'm Done, Save this Rotation`.

Configure the Nights and Weekends rotation
----------------------------------------------

#. Create the "Nights and Weekends' rotation by selecting :guilabel:`Add a Rotation`.
#. Name the rotation "Nights and Weekends" and select :guilabel:`Partial Day` for the first shift type.
#. Name the first shift "Weeknights".

    #. In the section with Monday through Friday in blue lettering, deselect Friday. Also, change the hours to cover all week-hours that are not covered by the Business Hours rotation. For example, if your  business hours are 8 AM to 5 PM, your Weeknights shift should be 5 PM to 8 AM. If your Business Hours are 9 AM to 4 PM, your Weeknights shift should be 4 PM to 9 AM.
    #. Change the :guilabel:`The next handoff happens` date to the next upcoming Monday.
    #. Select :guilabel:`Save Shift`.
    #. To add users to this shift, select :guilabel:`Manage Members` then :guilabel:`Select a User to add`. The order that you add the users in will dictate the week they end up on-duty. The first user you add will do the current week, the next user the week after, the third user the third week. You can re-order them after adding by dragging them on the :menuselection:`Members` page.

#. After adding the appropriate users, select :guilabel:`Add another Shift` and select :guilabel:`Multi-day` for the type.

    #. Name this shift “Weekends” and adjust the hours to those desired.
    #. Select :guilabel:`Save Shift`.
    #. To add users to this shift, select :guilabel:`Manage Members` then :guilabel:`Select a User to add`. The order that you add the users in will dictate the week they end up on-duty. You can re-order these users after adding by dragging them around within this menu.
#. When finished, select :guilabel:`I'm Done, Save this Rotation`.

Configure a Secondary rotation
-------------------------------------------

The next part of the configuration process will involve creating a Secondary rotation to serve as a backup in case either the Business Hours or Nights and Weekends user doesn't respond in a set amount of time.

#. Select :guilabel:`Add a Rotation`.
#. Name the rotation “Secondary” and select :guilabel:`24/7` for the shift type.
#. Name the shift “Secondary Shift” and change the handoff time to the appropriate one. This is typically when business hours begin for your organization.
#. Change the :guilabel:`The next handoff happens` date to the next upcoming Monday.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save Shift`.
#. To add users to the shift :guilabel:`Manage Members` then :guilabel:`Select a User to add`.The order that you add the users in will dictate the week they end up on-duty. The first user you add will do the current week, the next user the week after, the third user the third week. You can re-order these users after adding by dragging them around within this menu.
#. When finished, select :guilabel:`I'm Done, Save this Rotation`.


Configure the Escalation Policies
-----------------------------------------

Next, you will create an escalation policy. 

#.  Navigate to :menuselection:`Escalation Policies` and select :guilabel:`Add Escalation Policy`.
#.  Name this one "Secondary" and set the first step to immediately “Notify the on-duty users in rotation: Secondary”.
#.  Select :guilabel:`Save` and then refresh your page. This will allow the newly-created escalation policy to be available for selection in other escalation policies.
#.  Navigate to :menuselection:`Escalation Policies` and select :guilabel:`Add Escalation Policy`, and call the Policy Name “Business Hours”.
#. Set the first step to Immediately "Notify the on-duty users in rotation: Business Hours".
#. Select :guilabel:`Add Step` and set Step 2 to “If still unacked after 15 minutes”, “Execute Policy: Secondary”. 
    This will link the Business Hours and Secondary escalation policies together. If the Business Hours users doesn't respond after 15 minutes, the Secondary user will be paged.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save` and then refresh your page.
#. Select :menuselection:`Escalation Policies` and then :guilabel:`Add Escalation Policy`. Name this policy "Nights and Weekends".
    The format of this escalation policy is similar to the Business Hours escalation policy, with the Nights and Weekends rotation specified in Step 1 instead of the Business Hours rotation. This links the Nights and Weekends and Secondary escalation policies together so that if the Nights and Weekends
    on-call user doesn't respond in 15 minutes, it will escalate to the Seconday user.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save`.

Configure Routing Keys
---------------------------------

The final part of this configuration involves assigning routing keys to the Business Hours and Nights and Weekends escalation policies.

#. Navigate to :guilabel:`Settings` then :guilabel:`Routing Keys`.
#. On the :menuselection:`Routing Keys` page you can assign an existing routing key to the escalation policies, assign them to the Default Routing Policy, or create a new routing key and assign the escalation policies to it.
#. To assign the escalation policies to an existing routing key, hover your mouse over the key until a pencil icon shows on the far right, and then select the pencil icon.
#. Locate the Business Hours and Nights and Weekends escalation policies which are categorized under the team you've created them on and select them.
#. Select the blue checkbox to save your changes.
#. To assign the escalation policies to the Default Routing Policy, hover your mouse over the row until a pencil icon shows, and then select the escalation policies.

Scenario 2: Only get alerted for certain alerts during business hours
============================================================================


Main points:

- Create a Rotation called “Business Hours” with one Partial Day type shift for each user you would like on-call during Business Hours.
- Specify this Rotation in the first step of an Escalation Policy.
- Create a Routing Key called “bus-hours-only” and direct it at that Escalation Policy
- (Optional) Create Rules Engine  rules to have this Routing Key applied to the appropriate alerts.
