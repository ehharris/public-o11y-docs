Important Notes
---------------

-  This article explains how to set up SSO using SCIM/ULM configuration.
   If you need to set up SSO using **SAML configuration** instead, see :ref:`single-sign-sso`
-  Configuring SCIM Single Sign-On and initial activation of Okta
   provisioning with Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps) is currently
   not a self-service process and requires contacting the Support team.
-  Please note that the name of the app in Okta is **VictorOps
   (Beta)**. 

Warning
-------

**Deprovisioning a user will permanently delete the following attributes
from Splunk On-Call for that user, and the user will not be able to
login.**

-  Any Splunk On-Call user contact methods not present in Okta
-  User mobile device registration for push notifications
-  User paging policies
-  User team membership
-  User on-call rotation membership
-  Removes the user from any Escalation Policies and Scheduled Overrides
   for On-call.

**Reassigning a previously de-provisioned user will not recover the
above attributes in Splunk On-Call.**

Features
--------

**Single Sign-on using SAML and SCIM 2.0 user provisioning.**

The following provisioning features are supported:

-  Push New Users

   -  Okta users assigned to the VictorOps (Beta) App in Okta will have
      a Splunk On-Call username created and provisioned. 

-  Push User Deactivation

   -  Deactivating the user or disabling the user's access to the
      VictorOps (Beta application through Okta will deactivate the user
      in Splunk On-Call.
   -  Note: For this scenario, deactivating a user means removing the
      user from your Splunk On-Call organization.

      -  That user will no longer be able to login to Splunk On-Call
      -  That user will no longer be present in any on-call rotations

-  Reactivate Users

   -  User accounts can be reactivated in the application. The
      reactivated user will require certain manual reconfiguration in
      Splunk On-Call.

Final Steps

Once the above steps are done, your configuration for SSO SCIM is ready.
**You can now go ahead and assign the VictorOps (Beta)** **app to any
groups or users.** The provisioned users can use the Okta application
(chiclet) to log into Splunk On-Call using SSO.

Your VictorOps (Beta) app in Okta is now ready to provision new users to
your On-Call instance as well. Any new users you assign to the app will
be provisioned to On-Call and will use the email as the On-Call
username. 

User Provisioning Process
-------------------------

This section describes how Okta user accounts are linked to a Splunk
On-Call user account when the Okta–Splunk On-Call integration is
enabled.

User profiles are connected between the two systems as follows:

1. Okta sends a new user provisioning request to Splunk On-Call
2. Splunk On-Call retrieves the primary email attribute for the user
   from the request
3. Splunk On-Call searches for matching user profile containing the same
   email address

   -  If no users are found, a new user is created in Splunk On-Call.
   -  If exactly one user is found, the Okta user is linked to the
      Splunk On-Call user.
   -  If more than one user is found, an error is returned to Okta and
      the provisioning request fails. To fix this error, ensure the
      email address in Okta profile exists in only one user profile in
      Splunk On-Call.
   -  If a user is found but the accounts were already linked
      previously, an error is returned. Please reach out to Splunk
      On-Call Support to resolve this.

User Deprovisioning Process
---------------------------

Okta requests to deactivate user from Splunk On-Call are handled as
follows:

**For Users to be removed who are part of On-call rotations, Escalation
Policies or User is overriding another user's on-call in Scheduled
Overrides**

1. Find all the teams the user is part of or teams in which the user
took scheduled overrides or manual on-call. 2. For each team:

-  If the user is not part of on-call rotation or escalation policies in
   the team, then user is removed from the team. Otherwise proceed to
   next step.
-  Look for an admin in the team in this order: Team Admin, Alert Admin,
   Global Admin, Non-admin.
-  Users who have mobile device registered for push notification or
   verified phone number in their profile are given preference.
-  If there are more than one user resulting from above two steps, then
   pick the first user after sorting on username A->Z.
-  Place the resulting user as replacement for removed user in on-call
   rotations and escalation policies.
-  The replacement user is notified by email. In the email they get a
   list of rotations, escalation policies that were changed and also are
   told if any overrides changed.

3. If the user to be removed is the only member in a team, then an error
message is returned to Okta and the remove-user operation is not
completed in Splunk On-Call.

**For Users who manually took on-call from another user and is currently
on-call**

Same process as above.

**For User to be removed who is the only Global Admin in the Splunk On-Call org**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This operation is not supported and an error is sent back to Okta.

After the above checks and replacements are complete, the user is
removed from their org in Splunk On-Call and can no longer login.

Troubleshooting
---------------

-  **Test API Credentials fails in Okta**

   -  Ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces in the token copied
      from Splunk On-Call. If you continue to see this error, please
      contact the Splunk On-Call support team.

-  **Updates to user profile attributes in Okta are not reflected in
   Splunk On-Call**

   -  Updates to user profile attributes in Splunk On-Call, including
      username, are currently not supported. If updating a certain
      user's profile is really important, a workaround is to delete the
      user from Okta. And then create a new user in Okta and assign to
      the Splunk On-Call application. This will result in a new user
      being created in Splunk On-Call with the desired user profile
      attributes.

-  **Error: This Okta user is already linked to a different user in
   Splunk On-Call with the email address**

   -  You may receive this error if the Okta user is already linked to a
      user in Splunk On-Call. Please contact Splunk On-Call support.

-  **Error: More than one Splunk On-Call user was found with the Okta
   user email address**

   -  Ensure only one user exists in the Splunk On-Call organization
      with the given email address.

-  **Error: This user can not be removed from Splunk On-Call because
   they are the last Splunk On-Call Global Administrator for this
   organization**

   -  At least one Global Administrator is required to be present in an
      active Splunk On-Call account. Please login to Splunk On-Call and
      assign the Global Admin role to another user and retry this
      operation.

-  **Error: This user could not be removed from Splunk On-Call because
   they are part of an on-call rotation or escalation policies and a
   replacement user could not be found**

   -  Please login to Splunk On-Call and remove dependent on-call
      rotations, escalation policies or teams and retry this operation.

-  **Error: Another Okta user is already linked to the user in Splunk
   On-Call with this email address**

   -  

      -  Ensure only one Okta user exists with the given email address.

         -  Or check if the matching Splunk On-Call user has two email
            addresses, each pointing to a different Okta user. This type
            of mapping should be avoided.
