   Phase 1: Onboarding readiness <onboarding-readiness>
   Phase 2: Initial rollout <initial-rollout>
   Phase 3: Scaled rollout <scaled-rollout>

The journey for getting started with Splunk Observability Cloud has 3 phases: onboarding readiness, initial rollout, and scaled rollout. In the onboarding readiness phase, you set up users, teams, and access controls using roles and token management and lay the groundwork for connectivity. Next, in the initial rollout phase, you get your data into Splunk Observability Cloud and set up the Splunk Observability Cloud products for your initial project team use cases. In the final scaled rollout phase, you establish repeatable observability practices using automation, data management, detectors, and dashboards.
