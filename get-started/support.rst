      <h2>Use the Splunk Support Portal<a name="support-portal" class="headerlink" href="#support-portal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    </embed>

On March 17, 2022, the Splunk Observability Cloud (SignalFx) Support site joined the :new-page:`Splunk Support Portal <https://splunk.my.site.com/customer/s/>`, where you can create new cases, update your open cases, and search the knowledge base. You'll continue to receive the same world-class support from your Splunk Observability Cloud support engineers.

If you have an existing Splunk Observability Cloud (SignalFx) Support site account, here are some notable changes to the support process using the new Splunk Support Portal:

- All of your open cases have been migrated to the Splunk Support Portal.

- You can no longer create new cases by emailing ``observability-support@splunk.com`` or ``signalfx-support@splunk.com``.

- You can't use your existing Splunk Observability Cloud (SignalFx) Support site credentials to log in to the Splunk Support Portal. This also means that any single sign-on functionality that you used to log in to the Splunk Observability Cloud (SignalFx) Support site doesn't work to log you in to the Splunk Support Portal.

     For example, if you select the :guilabel:`Splunk Support Portal` link on the Splunk Observability Cloud application home page or navigate to :menuselection:`Settings` then :menuselection:`Support` in the application, you aren't automatically logged in to the Splunk Support Portal.

     To log in to the Splunk Support Portal, you must create a Splunk account, if you don't already have an account. You use your Splunk account credentials to log in to the Splunk Support Portal.

     Not sure if you have a Splunk account or can't remember your password or username? Use the :guilabel:`Forgot your password or username?` functionality on the :new-page:`Splunk Account Login page <https://login.splunk.com/>`.

      <h3>Create a Splunk account<a name="create-splunk-account" class="headerlink" href="#create-splunk-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
    </embed>

1. Go to the :new-page:`Create Your Account page <https://www.splunk.com/page/sign_up>` and complete the form to register for a Splunk account. Make sure to sign up using your business email address.

2. Check your email for a message from Splunk asking you to verify your email address. You must select the link in the email to verify your email address within 7 days or your account creation request expires. If you don't see the email in your inbox, make sure to check your spam folder.

3. Select the verification link in the email to access a page where you can log in to your Splunk account.

4. After you've logged in to your Splunk account, you can access the :new-page:`Splunk Support Portal <https://splunk.my.site.com/customer/s/>`. You can manually navigate to the Splunk Support Portal by selecting :guilabel:`Support` then :guilabel:`Support Portal` on :new-page:`splunk.com <https://www.splunk.com/>`.

     It can take up to 24 hours after creating your Splunk account for your Splunk Support Portal experience to reflect the correct entitlements for the products and permissions you have access to. A Splunk Support Portal administrator sets the entitlements for you.

     To learn more about entitlements, see "Entitlements" in :new-page:`Working with Support <https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/support/working-with-support.pdf>`.

5. To check on the status of your entitlements:

     1. Access the :new-page:`Splunk Support Portal <https://splunk.my.site.com/customer/s/>`.

     2. In the navigation menu, select :guilabel:`My Entitlements`.

   After your Splunk Support Portal entitlements have been set, you can submit and update cases for your products.
