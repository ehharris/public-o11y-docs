    :description: Share and export charts in Splunk Observability Cloud

Splunk Observability Cloud provides a number of ways to export and share a chart. The technique to use depends on several factors, such as the version you want to share, last saved version or version you are viewing that has unsaved changes, and whether you want to share the original or a copy.

.. _exporting-chart-contents:

Export chart contents
==========================

For line charts, area charts, column charts, and SLI charts, you can export the chart contents to a CSV file. The file contains the most recent 100 data points and the values of the dimensions associated with them.

* To export a chart from the Chart Builder view, open the :guilabel:`Data table` tab, then select :guilabel:`Export as CSV` download icon in the table headers row on the last column.
* To export a chart from the dashboard view, select the chart actions menu (|more|) and select :guilabel:`Export chart as CSV`. 

.. note:: You can only export SLI charts from the dashboard view.

.. _sharing-a-chart:

.. caution:: 

   
   Provide a browser's URL for a chart with caution; any changes someone makes to the chart are visible to everyone viewing the chart, and can overwrite changes others have made to the chart.

.. _share-feature-to-share:

Use the share feature to share a chart
----------------------------------------------

You can share a copy of a chart. Copies include unsaved changes at the time you share, and autoexpire unless the recipient saves them. Sharing a copy is perfect for when you make a change that you want to show your team members, but don't want to modify the original chart.

- To share a chart you are viewing in the Chart Builder, select the :guilabel:`Share` icon near the upper right corner of the chart or select :guilabel:`Share` from the chart actions menu (|more|).

- To share a chart you are viewing in a dashboard, select :guilabel:`Share` from the chart actions menu (|more|). See the following sections for more information.

.. _share-copy-directly-from-infra-monitoring:

Share a copy directly from Splunk Observability Cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can send a copy of the chart to an email address or to any available third-party services. To learn more, see :ref:`admin-notifs-index`.

After adding recipients, select :guilabel:`Share`. Recipients receive a link to the copy. When they open it, they can edit and save their copy without affecting the original.

.. caution:: 

   Administrators can add email addresses of people who aren't members of your organization. Recipients must create a user account before they can view the shared content. Be sure the email addresses you enter for nonmembers are correct, especially if the item you are sharing contains any sensitive or proprietary information.

.. _share-copy-using-a-link:

Share a copy by using a link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You might want to send out a personal email or post a link to the copy on an internal communication channel or website. To do this, select :guilabel:`Copy`. Only members of your organization with a login can see the chart you share.

.. _pasting-chart-url-into-slack:

Paste a chart URL into Slack
---------------------------------

You can give someone access to a chart by pasting the chart's URL into a Slack channel. Slack displays a preview image of the chart along with the URL. You can paste a URL that was generated by using the Share feature or by copying the chart's URL, as described in :ref:`sharing-a-chart`.

Note the following regarding this feature.

- The preview image appears in public channels, private channels, and direct messages that are visible to the user who authorized the Slack integration. For more information, see: :ref:`slack`.

- The preview image has a standard size and is always displayed using the light theme.

- The time zone is always represented in UTC.

.. note:: Troubleshooting

   If you don't see the preview image in Slack, possible reasons are:

   - An administrator in your organization needs to upgrade the Slack integration. For more information, see: :ref:`slack`.

   - The channel you are pasting into isn't visible to the user who authorized the Slack integration in Splunk Observability Cloud.

   - Your Slack settings block link previews or block links sharing.
