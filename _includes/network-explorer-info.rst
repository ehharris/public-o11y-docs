.. note:: 
  
  While Splunk Observability Cloud fully supports the Network Explorer navigator, the upstream OpenTelemetry eBPF Helm chart is not covered under official Splunk support. Any feature updates, security, or bug fixes to it are not bound by any SLAs. 
  
  If you wish to continue using Network Explorer to see data in Splunk Observability Cloud, point the upstream eBPF Helm chart to the OpenTelemetry Collector running as a gateway.
